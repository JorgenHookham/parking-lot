1. Clone this repository
2. To run tests from CLI: `npm run test`
3. To run with custom input from CLI: `node index.js "[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0]]"`
4. To run the solution in your own test suite: `const solution = require("./index");`

The biggest issue my solution has it tall parking lots. With more time, I'd optimize this, or consider a different approach if that proved too convoluted.
